	<h1>About Me</h1>
	
	<p>I am a senior at Montana Tech in Data Science, currently in what is my last semester (hopefully)</p>
	<p>Last year I took a year off of class to work at a job opportunity in Idaho.
	   The job was running a car rental counter that my boss for my then current job in Butte purchased.
	   When I got back in November, I took some time off to focus on finishing up school.</P> 
	<p>I have two cats, Thoth and Jetmir, who are brother and sister. In my free time I like to workout and play videogames</p>
