	<h1>Jungle</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>The jungle role is much different than the others since they don't have a specific lane to play in. Instead they roam across the whole
	map through the jungle. The jungle contains many different neutral monsters to hunt which provide bonuses. Unlike the lanes, jungle players
	can freely go into the enemy jungle to take the monsters on the other side, providing the enemy with less power. Junglers also get to help
	the lane players since the jungle is connected to each lane. For these reasons, jungle players are often said to be playing a game of chess
	against the other jungler since the enemy jungle could be anywhere and you need to balance helping your lane teammates and fighting jungle 
	monsters.</p>
