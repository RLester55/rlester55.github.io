		<p> This is my final semester at Montana Tech, I will be graduating in just a few days. I will be recieving a Bachelors degree in Data Science
			I had two other class this semester, M491 Linear Algrebra For Engineering and Data Science, and CSCI 443 UX design.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4"> 
		<p> Both of those classes had semester long projects. In M491, my project was on exploring RGB color spaces in the context of linear algebra.
			In that project I ended up also looking at color blindness, and using linear algebra to give examples of what that might look like
			as well as deriving the linear transformation matrix to apply color blindness effects.  </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4"> 
		<p> In CSCI 443, my project was based on my professor's own website called One Stop Shop
			(<a href="oss.weathershare.org/"target="_blank">OSS</a>). The whole class was tasked with the same problem, creating a large screen
			display that could be used in travel hubs such as rest stops and hotels. The project had a bunch of requirements but the main One
			is that it couldn't use user input.</p>
