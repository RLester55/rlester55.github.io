	<h1>Bot Lane</h1>
	<hr>
	
	<p>Bot lane characters are normally ranged marksmen. Marksmen have the highest damage but lowest defence out of the whole character roster.
	Other characters can do high damage, but marksmen are special because their damage is very consistant, not relying on cooldowns, and they
	have long range. This means marksmen can beat melee characters by never letting them get close and mages by having more consistant damage than they do.
	Bot lane characters also don't do much damage until later into the game. Because these characters never have much defense, and don't have
	much offense until later into the game, the bot lane has two players from each team, the bot laner and the support. The support is there to
	protect the bot laner until the bot laner can do enough damage to carry the team to victory.</p>
